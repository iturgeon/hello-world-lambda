## Hello World Lambda

An ultra simple starting point for testing and building Docker based Lambda function containers.
I needed this when I wanted to quickly build out an AWS infrastructure that included several Lambda API functions and just needed a placeholder to get started.

These images will be perfect as placeholders, but will also serve as an example on how to build out your own lambda function containers if you're having doubts, like I do every time I walk away and return to this.
